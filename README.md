# Oliver's dotfiles

I've had some dotfiles for a long time but...

1. I never organized them
2. They belonged to other people

So these are mine. Yippee!

Install procedure:
  1. Add ssh key to git, if you haven't made them yet then ssh-keygen
  2. git clone git@github.com:oliversong/homeconfig.git
  3. cd homeconfig
  4. ln -s FILE ~/FILE
